        <p>I started reading Ludwig Wittgenstein's <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> and got up to section 20 (the book's got short sections instead of chapters), highlighting as I went. Wittgenstein's examples of language games and word use are fascinating.</p>
<p>A book about the philosophy of language might not seem particularly related to gender but I've already picked out points about how assigning definitions to things that don't fit those definitions is often useless and counter-productive. And about how our English language is a jumble of things it's collected over time. I expect to see him develop these points through the book and I think I'll definitely be able to link a lot of points about how we <em>talk</em> about gender back to this book. It's a good starting point, especially because it's really engaging.</p>

        <p>I read sections 21-34 of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. Wittgenstein talked a lot about context behind language use and the intentions people have when ostensibly teaching and defining words in a language-game. He also emphsised the fact that any definition can be misinterpreted and one first has to understand <em>how</em> a word is used before they can understand its meaning.</p>

        <p>I just watched the Philosophy Tube video <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITRzvm0Xtg">Identity: A Trans Coming Out Story</a></em> and cried my eyes out because it's amazing. But also, there's a lot of valuable information about trans people, their lives, and their identities that I do want to look at in more detail and eventually write about. The metaphor of identity as a mosaic was one that I really liked. I probably won't read Audre Lorde's <em>Zami: A New Spelling of My Name</em> because it's not really focussed on gender specifically, but I might end up reading it for the discussions of identity, which vary wildly from Descartes' "Cogito ergo sum", or I'll just read it for fun. I also especially liked the comparison of living as a gender that one doesn't identify with as working at a bad job. There were some very valuable bits of information in that video.</p>

        <p>I read the first section of Chapter 1 of <em>Gender Trouble</em> by Judith Butler. It's incredibly dense and hard going, especially for someone who doesn't read much academia normally. They kept using words like <em>juridical</em> and <em>fictive</em>, which seemed unnecessarily opaque. Anyway, once I managed to parse it, the content was very interesting.</p>
<p>Butler mainly talked about how the category of 'woman' is blurry and ill-defined. It is a category that claims to represent a group of people but necessarily fails at doing that properly, as all identity politics must. Humans cannot be easily sorted into neat little categories. Every individual is unique and has their own, unique identity. As such, no one category can accurately claim to represent any whole group of people. There were some allusions near the end of the section to the idea that the concept of 'woman' merely serves to reinforce binary, hegemonically masculine gender norms.</p>
<p>There were some lovely ideas just in that first section and I'd love to see where Butler takes them. It's just a shame that I have to read practically every paragraph twice to understand what they're trying to say.</p>

        <p>I took a break from my EPQ, mainly due to COVID-lockdown-induced sub-par mental health, but I'm back.</p>
<p>I read chapter 1 section 2 of <em>Gender Trouble</em>, in which Butler talks about the blurriness of the concept of biological sex. It is ill-defined and hard to use for real things. It is "juridical", as they put it. Sex is a legal construction used to constrain people in boxes and make them easier to manage. It is often described as binary but very rarely actually is.</p>
<p>Butler suggests in this section that sex actually results from gender, not the other way around. Gender is socially constructed. It is also used, claims Butler, to establish a binary framing of sex as "prediscursive, prior to culture, [and] a politically neutral surface <em>on which</em> culture acts." From what I understand, Butler is claiming that sex, which is used as a basis for discrimination, is culturally derived from the socially constructed gender.</p>
<p>That is an <em>incredibly</em> interesting view, and I'm really looking forward to seeing where they take it.</p>

        <p>I read chapter 1 section 3 of <em>Gender Trouble</em>. In it, Butler talks mainly about the differing views of Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray on what gender is and how it is talked about in society.</p>
<p>Beauvoir wrote <em>The Second Sex</em>, which was already on my reading list, but I've now decided I want to read it straight after <em>Gender Trouble</em>. In Butler's account, Beauvoir argues that men are considered the default in society, and are thus not specially marked in discourse and culture; women are considered the Sartrian <em>Other</em>, and are thus explicitly marked  as <em>not men</em>, and therefore <em>different</em> in practically everything.</p>
<p>Irigaray claims that society is <em>phallogocentric</em> (only able to talk from the masculine perspective) and women are not marked as the <em>Other</em>, but rather, they are not marked at all. Instead, they are completely excluded from the hegemonic phallogocentric discourse of society by the very nature of the language we use. If society can't properly talk about women (because languages were developed by patriarchal societies and cultures), then they can't properly <em>think</em> or philosophise about women.</p>
<p>There was also a bit near the end of the section where Butler seemed to say that Beauvoir was arguing that men could practically transcend their bodies. The masculine body is considered the default and is thus equated with "universal personhood". This allows men to metaphorically disavow their physical bodies and attain real freedom. Women, on the other hand, are considered different from the norm, and are thus bound and almost enslaved by their physical bodies, unable to truly be free so long as <em>woman</em> is considered <em>different</em>.</p>

        <p>In Chapter 1 Section 4 of <em>Gender Trouble</em>, Butler talks about the failings of Irigaray's phallogocentrism, pointing out that gender oppression is seen across practically all cultures, so it can't really be blamed on one, Western-centric theory, and it's almost (epistemologically) imperialist to suggest as such.</p>
<p>They then go on to talk about various forms of oppression and the impossibility of trying to rank them. They are all inextricably linked and no one form of oppression can properly be tackled without tackling others.<br />
They talk about how suppression of the Sartrian <em>Other</em> is only one of many techniques used to oppress women, and it is also used in most forms of oppression.</p>
<p>They then talk about the unity of the category of "women" and its flaws. The category of "women" is not united, and Butler seems to suggest that it needn't be. They talk about one of the major flaws of coalitional politics being that it assumes unity as an end goal. Butler seems to advocate for an almost anarchistic coalitional discourse, where nothing is presumed to be the eventual outcome, and all voices and ideas are expressed freely. They suggest that power relations need to be addressed before any coalition like this could feasably happen. Of course, no oppressed group could speak freely in discourse while still being oppressed.</p>
<p>They then talk about how the presumption of unity just slows down real political action. The identity of an oppressed group doesn't really matter, as long as the group can cohesively work against its oppressors.</p>

        <p>In chapter 1, section 5 of <em>Gender Trouble</em>, Butler talks primarily about identity and the <em>metaphysics of substance</em>. They talk about what gender <em>is</em>, and whether it requires a pre-gendered subject, or is a set of free-floating attributes, merely applied to persons with certain anatomies. The conclusion of the section is that gender is neither, and is in fact performative - "constituting the identity it is purported to be." (p33)</p>
<p>Butler begins by discussing the nature of identity. They talk about how coherent personhood is not inherent or natural, but rather, socially constructed.<br />
They talk about how heteronormativity, or "the heterosexualization of desire" (p23), requires and creates discrete, oppositional, binary genders. In order to establish a heterosexual default, there must be two binary genders, in opposition, to be desired by each other. Heteronormativity serves to enforce both the heterosexual default, and the binary genders default.</p>
<p>They then suggest that we must first understand the "matrix of intelligibility" through which gender is constructed, before we have any chance of changing the social norms surrounding it. Can gender identity be understood as an effect of compulsory heterosexuality? Well, if we believe that, then we're just blaming all gender-based oppression on one thing, and that's just like blaming it all on phallogocentrism, which was naïve. Wittig and Foucault agree (although through entirely different means) that the category of sex itself would vanish if hegemonic heterosexuality was removed.<br />
Perhaps we can unite several different theories of sex and gender to produce something new?</p>
<p>Butler, rather than trying to unite several other theories, comes up with a completely new conceptualization of gender. They take a slight detour to talk about Monique Wittig. She, as did Beauvoir, pointed out that "women" are conflated with "sex" (anatomy, not intercourse). This allows men to freely get away with misogynistic sexualization and objectification of women. By destroying the category of sex, women would be freed from the synecdoche of woman equals vagina, which leads to systematic objectification and sexualization.</p>
<p>Butler goes on to talk about Michel Haar, and his critique of Nietzsche. He talks about substance and critiquing the notion of the psychological person itself. Butler then talks about Wittig's alternative critique of Nietzsche, where she shows that "persons cannot be signified within language without the mark of gender." (p28) Eventually, Butler gets to what is possibly my favourite sentence in the book so far. In the current matrix of intelligibility through which gender is understood, "one is one's gender to the extent that one is not the other gender." (p30) In the binary system of gender, both genders are implicitly defined as the opposite of the other gender. This framing enforces the binary system and disallows any freedom from it.</p>
<p>Butler then talks about Herculine Barbin, a "hermaphrodite" in nineteenth-century France. She killed herself at age 29. According to Foucault, the scandal in Barbin's life was not her unusual anatomy, but rather, her divergence from the binary gender norms. She was "the sexual impossibilty of an identity." (p31)</p>
<p>Finally, Butler begins their conclusion through Foucault's proposal that gender may be a set of "accidental attributes", rather than inherent to the subject. Butler talks about using attributes freely, rather than only in their gendered contexts and conludes by saying that "gender proves to performativve - that is, constituting the identity it is purported to be. In this sense, gender is always a doing." (p33) Gender is not inherent to the subject, or even fixed, rather, it is performative. Gender is how a person presents, acts, and <em>performs</em> within society.</p>
<p><em>Gender Trouble</em> is famous for being the book in which Judith Butler proposes their theory of gender performativity. That's why I chose to read it first; I thought it would be a good starting point for learning about gender and the philosophy surrounding it. It's been a tricky read for someone who doesn't normally read academic books and knows almost no philosophy, but it's been incredibly rewarding so far. I feel like I've learned a hell of a lot, and I haven't even finished chapter 1. I can't wait to see where Butler takes the next 150 pages or so.</p>
