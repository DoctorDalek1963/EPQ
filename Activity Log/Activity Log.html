        <p>I started reading Ludwig Wittgenstein's <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> and got up to section 20 (the book's got short sections instead of chapters), highlighting as I went. Wittgenstein's examples of language games and word use are fascinating.</p>
<p>A book about the philosophy of language might not seem particularly related to gender but I've already picked out points about how assigning definitions to things that don't fit those definitions is often useless and counter-productive. And about how our English language is a jumble of things it's collected over time. I expect to see him develop these points through the book and I think I'll definitely be able to link a lot of points about how we <em>talk</em> about gender back to this book. It's a good starting point, especially because it's really engaging.</p>

        <p>I read sections 21-34 of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. Wittgenstein talked a lot about context behind language use and the intentions people have when ostensibly teaching and defining words in a language-game. He also emphsised the fact that any definition can be misinterpreted and one first has to understand <em>how</em> a word is used before they can understand its meaning.</p>

        <p>I just watched the Philosophy Tube video <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AITRzvm0Xtg">Identity: A Trans Coming Out Story</a></em> and cried my eyes out because it's amazing. But also, there's a lot of valuable information about trans people, their lives, and their identities that I do want to look at in more detail and eventually write about. The metaphor of identity as a mosaic was one that I really liked. I probably won't read Audre Lorde's <em>Zami: A New Spelling of My Name</em> because it's not really focussed on gender specifically, but I might end up reading it for the discussions of identity, which vary wildly from Descartes' "Cogito ergo sum", or I'll just read it for fun. I also especially liked the comparison of living as a gender that one doesn't identify with as working at a bad job. There were some very valuable bits of information in that video.</p>
