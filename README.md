# EPQ

This is a simple repo to hold my A-Level EPQ (Extended Project Qualification). It is a personal repo containing a tex project and the research documentation to go with it.

It also contains my Activity Log and a small Python project to make writing that Activity Log easier.

If you're downloading this repo for your personal use, change the learner name, learner number, etc. in `Activity Log/.env`
