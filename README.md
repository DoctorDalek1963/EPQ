# EPQ

This is a simple repo to hold my A-Level EPQ (Extended Project Qualification). It is a personal repo containing a tex project and the research documentation to go with it.

It also contains my Activity Log and a small Python project to make writing that Activity Log easier.

If you're downloading this repo for your personal use, change the learner name, learner number, etc. in `Activity Log/.env`. The format should be <br><code>LEARNER_NAME=&lt;your learner name&gt;<br>
LEARNER_NUMBER=&lt;your learner number&gt;<br>
CENTRE_NAME=&lt;your centre name&gt;<br>
CENTRE_NUMBER=&lt;your centre number&gt;<br>
UNIT_NAME=&lt;your unit name&gt;<br>
UNIT_NUMBER=&lt;your unit number&gt;<br>
TEACHER_ASSESSOR=&lt;your teacher assessor&gt;<br>
PROPOSED_PROJECT_TITLE=&lt;your proposed project title&gt;</code>

If any of the values have spaces, they should be in double quotes like `"John Doe"`.
