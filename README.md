# EPQ

This is a simple repo to hold my A-Level EPQ (Extended Project Qualification). It is a personal repo containing a tex project and the research documentation to go with it. It also contains my [Activity Log](https://github.com/DoctorDalek1963/EPQ/tree/main/Activity%20Log) along with a small, accompanying Python project.
